I became the lead volunteer of [GDG-IITK](http://gplus.to/gdgiitk) some time back. During the last few months I took a [lecture](https://plus.google.com/110753063968867219389/posts/6tN1UTSihrR) on building a client application for a server for the students of CS654 at IIT Kanpur. And organized two courses, Google Study Jam and CS for Android, which had weekly lectures. But while preparing for the talk that I have to take tomorrow something struck me. I realized that I have passed a critical point in terms of the tech knowledge. I know atleast so much that now I can bore people for hours until their head hurts with all the new knowledge that they have gained! And that too with very little preparation. It took me less than 1/2 hour prepared these slides for tomorrow and the first thing that came to my mind after making these is, "Wooh! I have covered a lot of Java while experimenting with Android".
